Steganography
=============

The cutest little steganography library for iOS.

Encodes your secret message in the least significant bit of RGB values in the image. If you'd like to submit a pull request with more sophisticated steganographic methods (like <a href="http://csis.bits-pilani.ac.in/faculty/murali/netsec-09/seminar/refs/anuroopsrep.pdf">this one</a>) please feel free!
